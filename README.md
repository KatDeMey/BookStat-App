# Intro to BookStat

A digital book journal.

This project was created as a nod to my love of reading and tracking books. The design has been inspired by an existing app: StoryGraph which allows users to search for books, add them to various reading lists, and to share their reviews.

BookStat aims to do something similar, but will act more as a digital book-journal. This will allow users to log information in a way that suits them, and will allow for a level of creativity from the user.

To add books to your reading list, the user will be able to add the book Title, Author Name, number of pages, a user review or thoughts on the book and more. The user will also be able to link an image of the book cover, thus allowing the user to select the cover they like best to be displayed on their profile.
